# Backbone.js

This module is primarily intended to interface with Backbone.js

I am trying to implement a feature in Aurora where you will have your
Backbone.js Models and Collections auto-generated
from your Models and Collections.

The auto-generation will give you a boilerplate code where you will
add your own JS logic.

This feature will be a simple implementation, without AMD/Require.js support.
